# Deep-RL
My learning journey on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving control tasks (also called decision problems) by building agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error and receiving rewards (positive or negative) as unique feedback.

## Deep RL agents
